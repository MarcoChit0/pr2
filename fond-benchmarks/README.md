# FOND Benchmarks

Eventually these should be hosted somewhere central. For now, the growing list of merged benchmarks will be included with a pointer to where they come from. Notes are my (Christian Muise) best guess.

## FOND-SAT > Paladinus

- acrobatics
- beam-walk
- doors
- earth-observation
- islands
- miner
- tireworld-spiky
- tireworld-truck

## MyND

### tidyup-mdp

Was modified to fix some PDDL bugs: the `cup*` objects were moved from the problem files to constants in the domain, since they are mentioned explicitly in action preconditions.

## Misc

### st_mapfdu

From Thorsten Engesser on planning for implicit coordination. Strong cyclic plans exist, but it's the acyclic ones that are desired.

### puffbot_dialogue_pddl

From Milene Teixeira -- domain for building dialogue agents in the health-care setting.
